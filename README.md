## Disclaimer:
This web application was developed with instruction and guidance from Oregon State University's Data Structures course (CS 261) in Winter 2023.

## Files included:
static_array.py
programming_fundamentals.py
dynamic_array.py
bag.py
min_heap.py

### static_array.py
This file was provided as skeleton code by OSU CS 261 for utilization in development of the following py files:
programming_fundamentals.py
dynamic_array.py
bag.py
min_heap.py
This file was NOT created by me!

### programming_fundamentals.py
